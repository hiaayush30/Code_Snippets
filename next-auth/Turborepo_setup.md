You're looking at **TypeScript declaration merging**, which is a powerful feature in TypeScript that allows you to extend existing types from third-party libraries (like `next-auth`) without directly modifying their source code.

These `interface Session` and `interface User` declarations tell TypeScript:

"Hey TypeScript, whenever you encounter the `Session` or `User` types coming from the `next-auth` library, assume they also have these additional properties (`id` and `role` in `Session.user`, and `id`, `email`, `role` in `User`), even though the original `next-auth` library's type definitions might not explicitly include them."

Let's break down where each is "used" or, more accurately, where their extended types become available and useful:

### 1. `interface Session`

This interface primarily defines the shape of the `session` object that you interact with on the **client-side** and **server-side** after a user is authenticated.

**Where it's used/felt:**

* **`useSession()` hook (Client-Side):**
    When you use `const { data: session } = useSession();` in your React components (e.g., on a dashboard page), TypeScript will now know that `session.user` has `id` and `role` properties, in addition to `name`, `email`, `image` (from `DefaultSession['user']`).
    ```typescript
    import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react';

    function MyComponent() {
        const { data: session } = useSession();

        if (session) {
            // TypeScript now correctly understands these:
            console.log(session.user.id);   // '123'
            console.log(session.user.role); // 'admin' or 'user'
            console.log(session.user.name); // 'John Doe' (from DefaultSession)
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    Without your declaration, `session.user.id` or `session.user.role` would give you a TypeScript error because it wouldn't know those properties exist.

* **`getServerSession()` (Server-Side - Pages Router & App Router):**
    When you fetch the session on the server (e.g., in `getServerSideProps` or in an App Router server component/API route), the `session` object returned will also conform to your extended `Session` interface.
    ```typescript
    // Example: getServerSideProps (Pages Router)
    import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth/next';
    import { authOptions } from '../api/auth/[...nextauth]'; // Your NextAuth config

    export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
        const session = await getServerSession(context.req, context.res, authOptions);

        if (session) {
            // TypeScript knows:
            console.log(session.user.id);
            console.log(session.user.role);
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```

* **Next.js Middleware:**
    If you're using Next.js Middleware to protect routes, the session object you get there will also reflect your extended types.

### 2. `interface User`

This interface defines the shape of the `user` object that represents the user record as it comes **directly from your authentication source** (e.g., your database after a successful login, or from an OAuth provider's profile data). It's primarily used within NextAuth.js's **callbacks** on the **server-side**.

**Where it's used/felt:**

* **`jwt` Callback:**
    This is the most direct place where `interface User` is critically important. When a user first signs in, the `user` object passed to the `jwt` callback has the type defined by your `interface User`.
    ```typescript
    // In your next-auth configuration (e.g., pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts or packages/auth/index.ts)
    callbacks: {
        async jwt({ token, user, account, profile }) {
            // 'user' here is typed according to your 'interface User'
            if (user) {
                // You can access user.id and user.role without TypeScript errors
                token.id = user.id;
                token.role = user.role; // Store role in the JWT token
            }
            return token;
        },
        // ...
    }
    ```
    You use this to take custom properties from the incoming `user` object (which typically comes from your database or auth provider) and *add them to the JWT `token`*. The JWT `token` is what actually persists across requests and is used to build the `Session` object later.

* **`session` Callback (less common for directly using `User` properties for `Session`):**
    While the `user` object is also passed to the `session` callback, you typically augment the `session` object using properties you've already added to the `token` in the `jwt` callback. However, the type of the `user` object passed here still conforms to your `interface User`.
    ```typescript
    callbacks: {
        // ... jwt callback ...
        async session({ session, token, user }) {
            // 'token' here is typed by DefaultJWT + whatever you added in the jwt callback
            // 'user' here is typed by your 'interface User'
            if (token) {
                session.user.id = token.id as string;   // Access 'id' from token
                session.user.role = token.role as string; // Access 'role' from token
            }
            return session;
        },
    }
    ```

* **Custom `CredentialsProvider`'s `authorize` function:**
    If you implement a `CredentialsProvider` and your `authorize` function returns a `user` object, that object should conform to your `interface User`.
    ```typescript
    // Inside your CredentialsProvider config
    async authorize(credentials, req) {
        // ... authenticate user with your backend ...
        const dbUser = { id: "some-id", email: credentials.email, role: "user" }; // Example DB user
        return dbUser; // This 'dbUser' object is expected to match your 'interface User'
    }
    ```

### In essence:

* **`interface User`:** Describes the full user object from your database/auth provider, used internally by NextAuth.js on the **server-side** during the initial authentication flow (especially in `jwt` callback).
* **`interface Session`:** Describes the user information that will be exposed to your client-side application (and also available server-side), derived from what you put into the JWT `token` via the `jwt` callback.

These declarations are crucial for **type safety** and **developer experience** in a TypeScript Next.js project using NextAuth.js. They ensure that when you access `session.user.role` or `user.id`, TypeScript knows these properties exist and can provide autocompletion and catch errors at compile time.
